What is Git vs. GitHub?

Git is a source code version control system, which is a series of "commits" or snapshots of your code. You make the commits manually.

GitHub is a website (github.com) where you can publish your Git repositories for public download and possible collaboration.

10 steps of Github.

Step 1: Create a Repository on the GitHub Site
 - register for a GitHub account.

Step 2: Install and configure git

 - open terminal 
 - type : git config --global user.name "username"

Step 3: navigate to your source code directory 

Step 4: Intialize your git repository in terminal on the project , using the command
   git init

Step 5: add the remote origin for your code repository to your local machine
      git remote add origin 
 
Step 6: check your unstage files using the command 
    git status : red color indicates unstaged files

Step 7 : stage the files u want to commit 
     git add .

Step 8: check if files have been staged using git status : green color indicates staged files 

Step 9: commit your code to the code repository appending a message to it
     git commit -m "your message here"

Step 10: push ur code to the online repository using the command 
     git push origin master
